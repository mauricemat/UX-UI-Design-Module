# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Sending Pull requests without linking them to issues.
- Start doing tasks without a project board
- Meeting without an agenda ahead

## Continue Doing

- Meeting everyday
- Working hard
- Remain committed

## Start Doing

- Creating our respective homepages
- Interacting with other groups

## Lessons Learned

- Creating design requires a good understanding of the partner or user. it
  requires also to take into account external factors (time, technical skills of
  the person who will develop the webpage).

- The design that we create is not for us. We need to keep a certain distance to
  avoid creating a design that pleases us, but not the partner or user.

### Or remove extra steps?
